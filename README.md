# Nupi-Clinic
Nupi-Clinic is a clinic management application built using WPF, SQL database, and Entity Framework, following the MVVM design pattern.

## Features:
- CRUD Operations: Admin can perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for different entities such as Patients and Doctors

- Authentication Check: Secure login for Admin with authentication checks.

- Password Hashing: Utilizes the SHA256 algorithm to hash passwords before storing them in the database for enhanced security.

- SQL Database Interaction: Repositories are implemented to communicate with the SQL database for easier data management.

## Features to be Implemented
As of now, the Nupi-Clinic project includes essential features for clinic management. However, there are plans to improve the application with the following features:

- Appointment Management: Implement a feature for scheduling and managing appointments between patients and doctors.

- Enhanced Admin Login Security: Implement character checking and length validation for admin usernames and passwords.

- Enhance Admin: Enhance the admin login functionality to show a welcome message after a successful login. The welcome message will greet the admin by their name.

- Data Validation Rule: Implement a data validation to replace MessageBox.Show for displaying error messages to follow MVVM pattern.
